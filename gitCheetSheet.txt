  - **git add .**: Add all files in the current directory to be tracked for changes.

- **git log**: Show all the commits that were made.
  - Press "Enter" to see more available commits.
  - Press "q" to cancel showing more commits.

- **git log -n**: Show the last 'n' number of commits. (Replace 'n' with the desired number of commits)

- **git log -p**: Show all commits with details on what files have been changed or updated and their changes.

- **git log --stat**: Show all commits with details on what files have been changed.

- **git log --oneline**: Show all commits with just the short SHA ID and commit name.

Notes:
- Always double-check your commands and explanations for accuracy and clarity.
- The commit message is crucial as it describes the changes made in the commit.
- Use the options like -p, --stat, and --oneline in git log to get specific information about commits.
- Remember to replace placeholders like 'n' and 'commit_sha_id' with actual values when using the commands.
